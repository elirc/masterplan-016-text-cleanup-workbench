# M016: architecture decision laboratory

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

Architecture at this scale means assigning responsibilities and avoiding unnecessary synchronization. You do not need a distributed system diagram to make a consequential design choice. A small function boundary, a stable identifier or one CSS owner can determine whether a later change stays understandable.

## Decision review 1: Preserve the original alongside the result

**Reference rationale:** A cleanup preview should make losses inspectable. Each row keeps before and after, and the adapter never assigns the cleaned value back into the source control. A user can compare the transformation before deciding whether to adopt it. Empty lines remain records, so row positions do not shift silently.

**Question to resolve:** What information disappears if you filter out empty results before review?

### Write competing proposals

Proposal A is the reference approach. Proposal B must be a plausible alternative, not an obviously broken straw man. Describe what each stores, what each derives, which boundary each validates and where visible feedback occurs. For a static page, describe source order, container/child ownership and content behavior instead of inventing application state.

### Use the same acceptance examples

Run both proposals against the same ordinary case, boundary and future-change scenario. If they produce different behavior, decide whether the difference is permitted by the contract. If both satisfy the contract, compare the number of facts a maintainer must keep synchronized and the amount of unrelated work needed for the next feature.

| Criterion | Reference proposal | Alternative proposal | Evidence needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Meets current user contract | Fill in | Fill in | One discriminating example |
| Owns each fact in one place | Fill in | Fill in | Source or state diagram |
| Handles failure or missing input | Fill in | Fill in | Error/recovery sequence |
| Supports the next small story | Fill in | Fill in | Proposed bounded diff |

### Record the decision with a reversal condition

Write: “I choose A/B because this concrete example shows this cost. I would revisit the choice if this specific requirement appeared.” A reversal condition prevents the decision from becoming a slogan. Do not use a hypothetical million-user future to justify complexity that teaches nothing about the present example.

**Source anchor:** `public/core.js` and `public/app.js`. Inspect the actual dependency direction; a diagram that names layers but cannot identify a call or data flow is incomplete.

## Decision review 2: Keep normalization narrow

**Reference rationale:** The contract changes whitespace only. Lowercasing, punctuation stripping and accent removal could damage names or meaning. They are not slipped into the same helper because they require separate user intent and examples. JavaScript whitespace includes more than the ordinary space character; the documented regex is the exact boundary.

**Question to resolve:** Would collapsing spaces be appropriate inside every source-code string or poem?

## Decision review 3: Use idempotence as a second kind of check

**Reference rationale:** A known example checks an intended output. Idempotence checks that further passes do not keep changing that output. Neither replaces the other: a function returning an empty string for everything would be idempotent but wrong. Pair both properties with source-preservation checks.

**Question to resolve:** Name an idempotent implementation that violates the actual cleanup contract.

## A compact decision record you can copy

```text
Context and user need:
Current invariant:
Proposal A:
Proposal B:
Discriminating example:
Observed or predicted outcomes, clearly labeled:
Decision and reason:
Cost accepted:
Revisit when:
Verification still needed:
```

## Avoid accidental scope expansion

A new abstraction should answer a problem you can name in the current code or selected story. If the main benefit is that it looks more professional, ask what specific change becomes easier and what new concepts a junior now has to learn. Keep the reference small enough to trace.

## Transfer the review habit

When should a cleanup function leave an unusual value alone?

Use that question to compare this project with its paired curriculum repository. Cite the actual source or guide you inspected; do not claim the other repository uses a pattern merely because its name sounds related. Your comparison may conclude that the shared learning concept appears in a different implementation.
