# Six junior practice stories

[Debugging lab](04-DEBUGGING-LAB.md) · [Hints — use after an attempt](06-HINTS-AND-ANSWERS.md)

These are new exercises beyond the finished reference. No story is marked complete for you. Start a branch such as practice/story-01 and write acceptance examples before editing. Each plan leaves the actual code, wording and one design choice to you.

## Story 01: Count changed records

**Feature boundary:** Derive a count from before !== after and display it alongside total rows.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `cleanList` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: Unchanged, changed and empty rows produce independently verified totals.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.
6. Review the diff, explain the change without reading the solution, and record remaining limits.

**Acceptance evidence:** Unchanged, changed and empty rows produce independently verified totals.

**Left for you:** exact fixture values, names, wording, the implementation and the tradeoff decision. Do not open the hints until you have an example and a first attempt.

**Stretch only after completion:** add one adversarial example that a plausible but incorrect solution would fail. Explain why that example is more informative than adding three ordinary examples.

## Story 02: Add a copy-results action

**Feature boundary:** Offer explicit copying of cleaned rows while preserving the source editor and showing copy failure.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `cleanList` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: The source remains unchanged and the UI does not claim clipboard success if the API fails.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.
6. Review the diff, explain the change without reading the solution, and record remaining limits.

**Stretch only after completion:** add one adversarial example that a plausible but incorrect solution would fail. Explain why that example is more informative than adding three ordinary examples.

## Story 03: Make whitespace policy selectable

**Feature boundary:** Add a separate trim-only mode and keep the existing collapse mode.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `cleanList` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: Interior spacing is preserved in trim-only mode and collapsed only in the documented mode.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.

## Story 04: Highlight unchanged rows

**Feature boundary:** Render a textual unchanged marker for each stable source row.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `cleanList` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: The marker agrees with exact string equality and does not rely on color alone.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.

## Story 05: Expand Unicode fixtures

**Feature boundary:** Add non-Latin letters, emoji and punctuation examples with explicit expected strings.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `cleanList` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: The tests catch deletion or case folding outside the whitespace contract.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.

## Story 06: Add a resettable preview

**Feature boundary:** Clear derived results when the source changes and require another preview.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `cleanList` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: A displayed cleaned list cannot be mistaken for the current source after an edit.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.

## Additional planning checkpoints for stories 01–06

[Nine more stories, 07–15](11-NINE-MORE-STORIES.md) · [Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md)

Keep the original plans above. The following checkpoints add implementation and review depth without completing the exercise for you.

### Story 01 planning clinic: Count changed records

**Before editing:** restate the boundary in your own words: Derive a count from before !== after and display it alongside total rows. Identify the part of `public/core.js` or `public/app.js` that owns it. If your proposed design changes another owner, explain the dependency instead of opening every file for a broad rewrite.

**Acceptance matrix:** write ordinary, boundary and repeat/recovery rows that establish “Unchanged, changed and empty rows produce independently verified totals.” Include exact starting data or content and the expected retained information. Calculate expected values or inspect meaningful source order independently of the proposed implementation.

**First implementation slice:** make only enough of the change to demonstrate one acceptance row. Inspect the diff and predict the next row before running it. If your first slice is mostly setup or abstraction with no observable result, consider a smaller direct route.

**Review challenge:** sketch a plausible wrong solution that would pass a casual demonstration. Choose a counterexample that exposes its specific weakness. Ask an assistant to critique that example rather than immediately asking it to finish the entire feature.

**Evidence and explanation:** use npm test, plus the relevant real interaction or CLI observation. Record the actual observation and the limit of the check. Finish by naming a design decision you made yourself and explaining why the neighboring original behavior still holds.
